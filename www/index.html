              We'll send someone to hug a person of your choosing. It will
              be the standard arms-around, 3 second embrace, with a comforting
              hand-on-shoulders and smile afterwards.

            <p class="description">
              Perfect for those afraid of physical contact! We'll slowly approach
              the recipient, maintaining eye-contact, and wrap our arms around
              them without actually touching their body. We'll whisper "This is
              a non-touchy hug" in their ear so they know what's going on.

              We'll get on our knees to be head-height with the recipient, put
              one hand on their shoulder and say "I just want you to know, 
              I'm proud of you, son". This is intended for boys, but it's also
              great way to confuse a daughter or friend!
